# Converting media files

The [reading](./reading-media-files) and [writing](./writing-media-files) primitives in Mediabunny provide everything you need to convert media files. However, since this is such a common operation and the details can be tricky, Mediabunny ships with a built-in file conversion abstraction.

It has the following features:

- Transmuxing (changing the container format)
- Transcoding (changing a track's codec)
- Track removal
- Compression
- Trimming
- Video resizing & fitting
- Video rotation
- Video cropping
- Video frame rate adjustment
- Video transparency removal/preservation
- Audio resampling
- Audio up/downmixing
- User-defined video & audio processing

The conversion API was built to be simple, versatile and extremely performant.

## Basic usage

### Running a conversion

Each conversion process is represented by an instance of `Conversion`. Create a new instance using `Conversion.init(...)`, then run the conversion using `.execute()`.

Here, we're converting to WebM:
```ts
import {
	Input,
	Output,
	WebMOutputFormat,
	BufferTarget,
	Conversion,
} from 'mediabunny';

const input = new Input({ ... });
const output = new Output({
	format: new WebMOutputFormat(),
	target: new BufferTarget(),
});

const conversion = await Conversion.init({ input, output });
if (!conversion.isValid) {
	// Conversion is invalid and cannot be executed without error.
	// This field gives reasons for why tracks were discarded:
	conversion.discardedTracks; // => DiscardedTrack[]

	return;
}

await conversion.execute();

// output.target.buffer contains the final file
```

That's it! A `Conversion` simply takes an instance of `Input` and `Output`, then reads the data from the input and writes it to the output. If you're unfamiliar with [`Input`](./reading-media-files) and [`Output`](./writing-media-files), check out their respective guides.

::: info
The `Output` passed to the `Conversion` must be *fresh*; that is, it must have no added tracks or metadata tags and be in the `'pending'` state (not started yet).
:::

Unconfigured, the conversion process handles all the details automatically, such as:

- Copying media data whenever possible, otherwise transcoding it
- Dropping tracks that aren't supported in the output format

You should consider inspecting `isValid` and the [discarded tracks](#discarded-tracks) before executing a `Conversion`.

### Monitoring progress

To monitor the progress of a `Conversion`, set its `onProgress` property *before* calling `execute`:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({ input, output });

conversion.onProgress = (progress: number) => {
	// `progress` is a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
};

await conversion.execute();
```

This callback is called each time the progress of the conversion advances.

::: warning
A progress of `1` doesn't indicate the conversion has finished; the conversion is only finished once the promise returned by `.execute()` resolves.
:::

::: warning
Tracking conversion progress can slightly affect performance as it requires knowledge of the input file's total duration. This is usually negligible but should be avoided when using append-only input sources such as [`ReadableStreamSource`](./reading-media-files#readablestreamsource).
:::

If you want to monitor the output size of the conversion (in bytes), simply use the `write` event on your `Target`:
```ts
let currentFileSize = 0;

const stopListening = output.target.on('write', ({ start, end }) => {
	currentFileSize = Math.max(currentFileSize, end);
});
```

### Canceling a conversion

Sometimes, you may want to cancel an ongoing conversion process. For this, use the `cancel` method:
```ts
await conversion.cancel(); // Resolves once the conversion is canceled
```

This automatically frees up all resources used by the conversion process and will cause any ongoing call to `execute` to throw a `ConversionCanceledError`.

## Video options

You can set the `video` property in the conversion options to configure the converter's behavior for video tracks. The options are:
```ts
type ConversionVideoOptions = {
	discard?: boolean;
	width?: number;
	height?: number;
	fit?: 'fill' | 'contain' | 'cover';
	rotate?: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270;
	allowRotationMetadata?: boolean;
	crop?: { left: number; top: number; width: number; height: number };
	frameRate?: number;
	codec?: VideoCodec;
	bitrate?: number | Quality;
	alpha?: 'discard' | 'keep'; // Defaults to 'discard'
	hardwareAcceleration?: 'no-preference' | 'prefer-hardware' | 'prefer-software';
	keyFrameInterval?: number;
	forceTranscode?: boolean;
	process?: (sample: VideoSample) => MaybePromise<
		CanvasImageSource | VideoSample | (CanvasImageSource | VideoSample)[] | null
	>;
	processedWidth?: number;
	processedHeight?: number;
	group?: OutputTrackGroup | OutputTrackGroup[];
};

type MaybePromise<T> = T | Promise<T>;
```

For example, here we resize the video track to 720p:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	video: {
		width: 1280,
		height: 720,
		fit: 'contain',
	},
});
```

::: info
The provided configuration will apply equally to all video tracks of the input. If you want to apply a separate configuration to each video track, check [track-specific options](#track-specific-options).
:::

### Discarding video

If you want to get rid of the video track, use `discard: true`.

### Resizing video

The `width`, `height` and `fit` properties control how the video is resized. If only `width` or `height` is provided, the other value is deduced automatically to preserve the video's original aspect ratio. If both are used, `fit` must be set to control the fitting algorithm:
- `'fill'` will stretch the image to fill the entire box, potentially altering aspect ratio.
- `'contain'` will contain the entire image within the box while preserving aspect ratio. This may lead to letterboxing.
- `'cover'` will scale the image until the entire box is filled, while preserving aspect ratio.

If `width` or `height` is used in conjunction with `rotation` or `crop`, they control the post-rotation, post-crop dimensions.

If you want to apply max/min constraints to a video's dimensions, check out [track-specific options](#track-specific-options).

In the rare case that the input video changes size over time, the `fit` field can be used to control the size change behavior (see [`VideoEncodingConfig`](./media-sources#video-encoding-config)). When unset, the behavior is `'passThrough'`.

### Rotating video

`rotation` rotates the video by the specified number of degrees clockwise. This rotation is applied on top of any rotation metadata in the original input file and happens before cropping and resizing.

By default, Mediabunny will try to make use of rotation metadata in the output file to perform the rotation whenever possible. However, if you don't want this to happen, or you want to use Mediabunny to strip all rotation metadata from a file, you can set `allowRotationMetadata` to `false`.

### Cropping video

`crop` can be used to extract a rectangular region from the original video. The rectangle is specified using `left`, `top`, `width` and `height` and is clamped to the dimensions of the video. Cropping is applied after rotation but before resizing.

### Adjusting frame rate

The `frameRate` property can be used to set the frame rate of the output video in Hz. If not specified, the original input frame rate will be used (which may be variable).

### Transcoding video

Use the `codec` property to control the codec of the output track. This should be set to a [codec](./supported-formats-and-codecs#video-codecs) supported by the output file, or else the track will be [discarded](#discarded-tracks).

Use the `bitrate` property to control the bitrate of the output video. For example, you can use this field to compress the video track. Accepted values are the number of bits per second or a [subjective quality](./media-sources#subjective-qualities). If this property is set, transcoding will always happen. If this property is not set but transcoding is still required, `QUALITY_HIGH` will be used as the value.

Use the `keyFrameInterval` property to control the maximum interval in seconds between key frames in the output video. Setting this fields forces a transcode.
If you want to prevent direct copying of media data and force a transcoding step, use `forceTranscode: true`.

Use the `hardwareAcceleration` property to control whether hardware or software acceleration is used for video transcoding.

### Processing video

The `process` property can be used to define a custom video sample processing function, e.g. for [applying overlays](./quick-start#add-a-video-overlay), color transformations, or timestamp modifications. You are expected to perform this processing yourself, for example using the Canvas API.

An example:
```ts
let ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D | null = null;
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	video: {
		process: (sample) => {
			if (!ctx) {
				const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(
					sample.displayWidth,
					sample.displayHeight,
				);
				ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')!;

				// Convert the video to grayscale
				ctx.filter = 'saturate(0)';
			}
			
			sample.draw(ctx, 0, 0);

			return ctx.canvas;
		},
	},
});
```

The function is called for each input video sample after transformations and frame rate corrections. It must return a [`VideoSample`](./packets-and-samples#videosample), something that can convert to a `VideoSample`, an array of them, or `null` for dropping the frame.

This function can also be used to manually resize frames. When doing so, you should signal the post-process dimensions using the `processedWidth` and `processedHeight` fields, which enables the encoder to better know what to expect.

## Audio options

You can set the `audio` property in the conversion options to configure the converter's behavior for audio tracks. The options are:
```ts
type ConversionAudioOptions = {
	discard?: boolean;
	codec?: AudioCodec;
	bitrate?: number | Quality;
	numberOfChannels?: number;
	sampleRate?: number;
	sampleFormat?: 'u8' | 's16' | 's32' | 'f32';
	forceTranscode?: boolean;
	process?: (sample: AudioSample) => MaybePromise<
		AudioSample | AudioSample[] | null
	>;
	processedNumberOfChannels?: number;
	processedSampleRate?: number;
};

type MaybePromise<T> = T | Promise<T>;
```

For example, here we convert the audio track to mono and set a specific sample rate:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	audio: {
		numberOfChannels: 1,
		sampleRate: 48000,
	},
});
```

::: info
The provided configuration will apply equally to all audio tracks of the input. If you want to apply a separate configuration to each audio track, check [track-specific options](#track-specific-options).
:::

### Discarding audio

If you want to get rid of the audio track, use `discard: true`.

### Resampling audio

The `numberOfChannels` property controls the channel count of the output audio (e.g., 1 for mono, 2 for stereo). If this value differs from the number of channels in the input track, Mediabunny will perform up/downmixing of the channel data using [the same algorithm as the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#audio_channels).

The `sampleRate` property controls the sample rate in Hz (e.g., 44100, 48000). If this value differs from the input track's sample rate, Mediabunny will resample the audio.

### Transcoding audio

Use the `codec` property to control the codec of the output track. This should be set to a [codec](./supported-formats-and-codecs#audio-codecs) supported by the output file, or else the track will be [discarded](#discarded-tracks).

Use the `bitrate` property to control the bitrate of the output audio. For example, you can use this field to compress the audio track. Accepted values are the number of bits per second or a [subjective quality](./media-sources#subjective-qualities). If this property is set, transcoding will always happen. If this property is not set but transcoding is still required, `QUALITY_HIGH` will be used as the value.

If you want to prevent direct copying of media data and force a transcoding step, use `forceTranscode: true`.

### Processing audio

The `process` property can be used to define a custom audio sample processing function, e.g. for applying audio effects, transformations, or timestamp modifications. You are expected to perform this processing yourself.

The function is called for each input audio sample after remixing and resampling. It must return an [`AudioSample`](./packets-and-samples#audiosample), an array of them, or `null` for dropping the sample.

This function can also be used to manually perform remixing or resampling. When doing so, you should signal the post-process parameters using the `processedNumberOfChannels` and `processedSampleRate` fields, which enables the encoder to better know what to expect.

## Subtitle options

You can set the `subtitle` property in the conversion options to configure the converter's behavior for subtitle tracks. The options are:
```ts
type ConversionSubtitleOptions = {
	discard?: boolean;
	codec?: SubtitleCodec;
};
```

For example, here we convert all subtitle tracks to WebVTT format:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	subtitle: {
		codec: 'webvtt',
	},
});
```

::: info
The provided configuration will apply equally to all subtitle tracks of the input. If you want to apply a separate configuration to each subtitle track, check [track-specific options](#track-specific-options).
:::

### Discarding subtitles

If you want to get rid of subtitle tracks, use `discard: true`.

### Converting subtitle format

Use the `codec` property to control the format of the output subtitle tracks. This should be set to a [codec](./supported-formats-and-codecs#subtitle-codecs) supported by the output file, or else the track will be [discarded](#discarded-tracks).

Subtitle tracks are always copied (extracted and re-muxed as text), never transcoded, so there is no quality loss. The supported formats are WebVTT, SRT, ASS/SSA, TX3G, and TTML.

## Track-specific options

You may want to configure your video, audio, and subtitle options differently depending on the specifics of the input track. Or, in case a media file has multiple tracks of the same type, you may want to discard only specific tracks or configure each track separately.

For this, instead of passing an object for `video`, `audio`, or `subtitle`, you can instead pass a function:

```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,

	// Function gets invoked for each video track:
	video: async (videoTrack) => {
		if (videoTrack.number > 1) {
			// Keep only the first video track
			return { discard: true };
		}

		return {
			// Shrink width to 640 only if the track is wider
			width: Math.min(await videoTrack.getDisplayWidth(), 640),
		};
	},

	// Async functions work too:
	audio: async (audioTrack) => {
		if (await audioTrack.getLanguageCode() !== 'rus') {
			// Keep only Russian audio tracks
			return { discard: true };
		}

		return {
			codec: 'aac',
		};
	},

	// Works for subtitles too:
	subtitle: (subtitleTrack, n) => {
		if (subtitleTrack.languageCode !== 'eng' && subtitleTrack.languageCode !== 'spa') {
			// Keep only English and Spanish subtitles
			return { discard: true };
		}

		return {
			codec: 'webvtt',
		};
	},
});
```

For documentation about the properties of video, audio, and subtitle tracks, refer to [Reading track metadata](./reading-media-files#reading-track-metadata).

## Track fan-out

You can also set (or return) an array of options for a single input track, which causes Mediabunny to create one output track per entry, or, in other words, multiple output tracks from one input track (fan-out).

This is useful for producing multiple renditions at different qualities, e.g. for [HLS](./output-formats#hls):
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	video: [
		{ height: 1080, bitrate: QUALITY_HIGH },
		{ height: 720, bitrate: QUALITY_MEDIUM },
		{ height: 480, bitrate: QUALITY_LOW },
	],
});
```

## Trimming

Use the `trim` property in the conversion options to extract only a section of the input file into the output file:

```ts
type ConversionOptions = {
	// ...
	trim?: {
		start: number; // in seconds
		end: number; // in seconds
	};
	// ...
};
```

For example, here we extract a clip from 10s to 25s:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	trim: {
		start: 10,
		end: 25,
	},
});
```

In this case, the output will be 15 seconds long.

If only `start` is set, the clip will run until the end of the input file. If only `end` is set, the clip will start at the beginning of the input file.

Note that when using the trimming defaults, the resulting media file will always begin at timestamp 0. If your input file has a start time offset (like is common with MPEG-TS files) and you want to retain that, use `trim: { start: 0 }` to ensure timestamps don't get shifted.

---

You can even use negative trimming values to offset the start of the media:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	// ...
	trim: {
		start: -2, // Two seconds of no media data (freeze frame / silence) at the start
	},
	// ...
});
```

## Metadata tags

By default, any [descriptive metadata tags](../api/MetadataTags.md) of the input will be copied to the output. If you want to further control the metadata tags written to the output, you can use the `tags` options:

```ts
// Set your own metadata:
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	// ...
	tags: {
		title: 're:Turning',
		artist: 'Alexander Panos',
	},
	// ...
});

// Or, augment the input's metadata:
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	// ...
	tags: (inputTags) => ({
		...inputTags, // Keep the existing metadata
		images: [{ // And add cover art
			data: new Uint8Array(...),
			mimeType: 'image/jpeg',
			kind: 'coverFront',
		}],
		comment: undefined, // And remove any comments
	}),
	// ...
});

// Or, remove all metadata
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	// ...
	tags: {},
	// ...
});
```

## Selecting tracks

Use the `tracks` option to control which input tracks are considered for conversion:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	tracks: 'primary', // Only the primary video and audio tracks
});
```

Accepted values are `'all'` or `'primary'`. The default is `'all'`, unless the input format is HLS, then it is `'primary'`. This is because HLS typically has multiple renditions of a track, and converting all of them is (usually) not desired.

For a more granular selection, use the `discard` field on the tracks.

## Discarded tracks

If an input track is excluded from the output file, it is considered *discarded*. The list of discarded tracks can be accessed after initializing a `Conversion`:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({ input, output });
conversion.discardedTracks; // => DiscardedTrack[]

type DiscardedTrack = {
	// The track that was discarded
	track: InputTrack;
	// The reason for discarding the track
	reason:
		| 'discarded_by_user'
		| 'max_track_count_reached'
		| 'max_track_count_of_type_reached'
		| 'unknown_source_codec'
		| 'undecodable_source_codec'
		| 'no_encodable_target_codec';
};
```

Since you can inspect this list before executing a `Conversion`, this gives you the option to decide if you still want to move forward with the conversion process.

If `isValid` is `false`, then the discarded tracks caused the `Conversion` to become invalid. For example, this can happen when a format requires a specific codec but that codec cannot be encoded.

---

The following reasons exist:
- `discarded_by_user`\
	You discarded this track by setting `discard: true`.
- `max_track_count_reached`\
	The output had no more room for another track.
- `max_track_count_of_type_reached`\
	The output had no more room for another track of this type, or the output doesn't support this track type at all.
- `unknown_source_codec`\
	We don't know the codec of the input track and therefore don't know what to do with it.
- `undecodable_source_codec`\
	The input track's codec is known, but we are unable to decode it.
- `no_encodable_target_codec`\
	We can't find a codec that we are able to encode and that can be contained within the output format. This reason can be hit if the environment doesn't support the necessary encoders, or if you requested a codec that cannot be contained within the output format.

---

On the flip side, you can always query which input tracks made it into the output:
```ts
const conversion = await Conversion.init({ input, output });
conversion.utilizedTracks; // => InputTrack[]
```
A track may appear multiple times in this list when [fan-out](#track-fan-out) produces multiple output tracks from it.

## Converting live streams

Live inputs, like HLS live streams, can also be used with the Conversion API. In this case, by default, the conversion will run until the live stream has ended.

If you only want to convert a part of the live stream instead of waiting until it has ended, you can [trim](#trimming) the conversion. For example, here we're capturing the next 60 seconds of the live stream:
```ts
// Get the live edge
const currentDuration = await input.getDurationFromMetadata(undefined, {
	skipLiveWait: true,
});

const conversion = await Conversion.init({
	input,
	output,
	trim: {
		// Start at the current live edge
		start: currentDuration,
		// End at most 60 seconds later
		end: currentDuration + 60,
	},
});
```
